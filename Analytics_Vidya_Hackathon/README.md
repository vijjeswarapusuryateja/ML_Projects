Problem Statement:

We are provided with the customer leads data of last year containing both direct and indirect leads. Each customer lead provides information about their activity on the platform, signup information and campaign information.Â Based on his/her past activity on the platform, we need to build the predictive model to classify if the user would buy the product in the next 3 months or not. 

Business Benefits:

The marketing & sales team wants to identify the leads who are more likely to buy the product so that the sales team can manage their bandwidth efficiently by targeting these potential leads and increase the sales in a shorter span of time

Data Dictionary:

We are provided with 3 files - train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv and train.csv contains the leads information. And also, the target variable indicating if the user will buy the product
